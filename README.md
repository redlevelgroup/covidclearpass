# COVID ClearPass App
The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed how we live, work, and interact. Our new normal is anything but. Social distancing, location capacity restrictions, and health screenings are now everyday business challenges.

We designed the COVID ClearPass app from the ground up with safety in mind. ClearPass helps you take proper measures to prevent the spread of the virus while maintaining a socially distanced workplace. With ClearPass, your workforce has access to mission-critical tools right on their phone; screen for COVID symptoms, queue location access, and share key information.

Red Level offers two distinct versions of the COVID ClearPass app for organizations of all sizes – a free version that integrates with your existing Microsoft 365 platform and a paid web app version that works great for users of G-Suite and others.

Built from the latest State Executive Orders, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, and the World Health Organization recommendations, ClearPass helps you protect your workforce and protect your business.

## FAQ

### What licenses do I need to run this solution?
The solution in this app uses Office connectors, therefore a seeded Power Apps license from Office is sufficient to run and play the user and admin apps. More information: Power Platform licensing overview. If you want to use the Power BI report (packaged as part of the solution), you'll need a Power BI license. More information: Power BI pricing
